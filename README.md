# MvnCentral_CustomDependency_test
It is a silly project that tests the implementation of a custom library previously uploaded and released to Maven Central.

The artifactId is "dataStructures" consisting of a unique class "Persona". I have added this dependency in the pom of this repo and I have created a "Persona" object in the main in order to prove that the library is functioning correctly and tha it is available for the general public.
